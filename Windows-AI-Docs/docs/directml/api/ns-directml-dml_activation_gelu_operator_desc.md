# DML_ACTIVATION_GELU_OPERATOR_DESC structure (directml.h)

Performs the gaussian error linear unit (GELU) activation function on every element in *InputTensor*, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
f(x) = 0.5 * x * (1.0 + erf(x / sqrt(2)))
```

Where erf(x) is [DML_ELEMENT_WISE_ERF_OPERATOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_element_wise_erf_operator_desc).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DirectML standalone redistributable package (see [Microsoft.AI.DirectML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/) version 1.9 and later. Also see [DirectML version history](../dml-version-history.md).

## Syntax

```cpp
struct DML_ACTIVATION_GELU_OPERATOR_DESC
{
    const DML_TENSOR_DESC* InputTensor;
    const DML_TENSOR_DESC* OutputTensor;
};
```

## Members

`InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

`OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in **DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_5_1**.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16 |
