# NamedDimensionOverride interface

Provides the ability to override named input dimensions to concrete values through [LearningModelSessionOptions](/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning.learningmodelsessionoptions) in order to achieve better runtime performance. Using this API can yield performance improvements, as it allows for preallocation of tensors during session creation that would otherwise be allocated during model evaluation.

## Sample Code

```cpp
void SetNamedDimensionOverrides(LearningModel model) {
    // Create LearningModelSessionOptions
    auto options = LearningModelSessionOptions();
 
    // Override a named input dimension to a concrete value
    options->OverrideNamedDimension(L"dimension_name", 256);
 
    // Create session
    LearningModelSession session = nullptr;
    session = LearningModelSession(model, LearningModelDeviceKind::GPU, options);
}

```
