# Windows ML APIs in Windows.AI.MachineLearning

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the latest documentation about Windows Machine Learning, see [What is Windows ML](/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview). That documentation describes APIs that are in the **Microsoft.Windows.AI.MachineLearning** namespace, which ships in the Windows App SDK. Those APIs supersede the ones documented here, which are in the **Windows.AI.MachineLearning** namespace, and were shipped in 2018.

The `Windows.AI.MachineLearning` Windows ML (WinML) APIs are divided into core APIs, custom operators, and native APIs.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Core APIs](/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning) | The main WinML APIs that are used to load, bind, and evaluate models. Located in the **Windows.AI.MachineLearning** namespace. |
| [Custom operators](custom-operators.md) | APIs that handle custom operators in WinML. Located in **MLOperatorAuthor.h**. |
| [Native APIs](native-apis.md) | Native WinML APIs that let you interact with Direct3D. Located in **windows.ai.machinelearning.native.h**. |
